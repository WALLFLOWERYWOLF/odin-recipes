# odin-recipes

This project is to create a recipe website that would feature recipes of my 3 most favorite dishes.
It will consist of a total of 4 pages, 3 pages that would each feature one of the recipes of the previously mentioned dishes along with their respective images.
Finally, it will also consist of a homepage that would feature the 3 recipe pages.
I will be demonstrating all of the HTML skills that I have learned so far on The Odin Project.
