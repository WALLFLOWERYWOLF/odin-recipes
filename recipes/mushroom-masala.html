    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This Mushroom Masala recipe is an easy, delicious Punjabi style one-pot
      mushroom Curry made with white button mushrooms in a spiced onion-tomato
      gravy. Though I have made the curry in a pan, I also cover Instant Pot
      instructions after my step-by-step guide below.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ to 1 cup chopped onions 100 grams or 2 medium onions</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chopped ginger or 1 inch ginger</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chopped garlic or 4 to 5 medium-sized garlic</li>
      <li>
        ½ cup chopped tomatoes (tightly packed) 70 grams or 2 small to medium
        tomatoes or ⅓ cup tomato puree
      </li>
      <li>200 to 250 grams white button mushrooms</li>
      <li>4 tablespoon Curd (yogurt) whisked till smooth</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons oil any neutral oil</li>

      <li>2 small tejpatta or 1 medium to large tejpatta (Indian bay leaf)</li>
      <li>½ inch cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 black cardamom (optional)</li>
      <li>2 green cardamoms</li>
      <li>3 cloves</li>
      <li>1 single strand of mace (optional)</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon turmeric powder (ground turmeric)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Coriander Powder (ground coriander)</li>
      <li>¾ cup water and ⅓ cup water for Instant Pot (add as needed)</li>
      <li>salt as required</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon Garam Masala</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) (crushed)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves (cilantro)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse or wipe dry the mushrooms. Slice off a part of the base stalk.
        Then slice or chop them. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a grinder or blender, take the chopped onions, ginger and garlic.
        Grind to a smooth paste without adding any water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove this paste with a spoon or spatula in a bowl and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same jar, add the chopped tomatoes and make a smooth puree. No
        need to blanch tomatoes before pureeing. Set the tomato puree aside.
      </li>
      <li>In a small bowl, whisk curd (yogurt) until smooth and set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a pan and add the following whole spices - cumin seeds,
        tejpatta, cinnamon, black cardamom, green cardamoms, cloves and a single
        strand of mace.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry the spices for a few seconds until they become aromatic and
        splutter.
      </li>
      <li>Lower the heat and add the ground onion-ginger-garlic paste.</li>
      <li>
        Mix the paste with the oil. If the paste splutters then cover the pan
        with a lid allowing for some space for the steam to pass.
      </li>
      <li>
        On a low to medium heat stirring often continue to sauté until the onion
        paste starts thickening.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir and sauté until the paste becomes golden. This sautéing of onion
        paste takes some time. So to quicken the process add a pinch of salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now add the tomato puree. Stir. Then add the spice powders - turmeric
        powder, red chilli powder and coriander powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix well and sauté until you see oil releasing from the sides of the
        masala.
      </li>
      <li>Add the sliced or chopped white button mushrooms.</li>
      <li>
        Add the beaten curd (yogurt). As soon as you add yogurt, mix thoroughly
        and quickly.
      </li>
      <li>Simmer on a low to medium flame for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Then add water.</li>
      <li>Season with salt. Mix very well.</li>
      <li>
        Cover the pan with a lid. On a low to medium heat simmer the mushroom
        masala for 18 to 20 minutes or until the mushrooms are tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly add dried fenugreek leaves (crushed), garam masala powder and
        chopped coriander leaves. Mix again. At this step you can add 1 to 2
        tablespoons of heavy cream for a rich tasting curry.
      </li>
      <li>Serve mushroom masala hot or warm.</li>
