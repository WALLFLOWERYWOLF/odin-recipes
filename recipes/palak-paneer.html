    <h2>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Palak Paneer is one of the most popular Indian dish made with succulent
      Paneer cubes (Indian cottage cheese) in a smooth spinach sauce. I share
      two ways to make this healthy dish a homestyle version and a restaurant
      style version with a charcoal smoking method (brought back on reader's
      demand). Both the vibrant green palak paneer recipes are made with fresh
      spinach leaves (palak in Hindi), aromatics, herbs and spices. Make these
      super delicious spinach paneer recipes with my easy step-by-step photo
      guide and video.
